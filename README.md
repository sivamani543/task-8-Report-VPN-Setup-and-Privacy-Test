## 🔐 VPN Concepts Brief

### What is a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a secure server, masking your real IP address.

### How It Protects Privacy

### Encryption Protocol Used

- *Cipher:* AES-256-CBC  
- *Authentication:* SHA256

### VPN Limitations
